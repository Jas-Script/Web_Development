# why do we need react ?

Some advantages of React are:

1. It is composable.
2. It is declarative.
3. Write once, learn anywhere.
4. It is simple.
5. SEO friendly.
6. Fast, efficient, and easy to learn.

# 1. It is composable:
 Composition is a function of combining parts or elements to form a whole. In the old days of web development a website was usually a single html page. So, a lot of time those web pages ended up being very long with thousands of lines of HTML codes. With modern frameworks like React, we can divide these codes and put it in custom components. Then we can utilize these components and integrate them into one place. Hence the code becomes a lot more maintainable and flexible. JSX is used for templating in React. JSX is a simple JavaScript that permits HTML quotation elements and uses these HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents.

# 2. It is declarative:
 In react the DOM is declarative. We can make interactive UIs by changing the state of the component and React takes care of updating the DOM according to it. This means we never interact with DOM. Hence, it makes it easier to design UI and debug them. We can just change the program’s state and see how the UI will look at that particular time. This makes our code more predictable and easier to debug.

# 3. Write once, learn anywhere: 
We can develop new features in React without re-writing the existing code. It can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native. So we can create IOS, Android, and Web applications simultaneously. In conclusion, extensive code reusability is supported by React.

# 4. It is simple:
 The component-based approach, automatic rendering, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a web (and mobile applications), and support it. We can mix Javascript and HTML together to create a special syntax called JSX which makes it easier to grasp and work with it.

# 5. SEO friendly: 
SEO is about making it easier for developers to find the right content for the user. When a user makes a search, search engine platforms like Google, Yahoo, Bing or Baidu tries to find which page is the most relevant to that specific search. React affects the SEO by giving you a SPA (Single Page Application) which requires Javascript to show the content on the page which can then be rendered and indexed.

# 6. Fast, efficient, and easy to learn:
 It contains pre-built patterns and functions that can be chosen and combined like building blocks to create fast, appealing, and scalable projects in less time as compared to designing the entire application line by line. Also, unlike Angular and Ember which are referred to as ‘Domain-specific Language’, React only requires need a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS fundamentals to start working with it.
