# Introduction to Servers and HTTP
## what are servers ?
In computing, a server is a computer or computers that send data over a network. This data can be a website, a program or photo file, or even information about the weather for an app on your phone.

Servers listen for requests from clients, which are other computers or devices. When a server hears a request, it reads it and responds by sending data back to the client.

## what is HTTP?

HTTP refers to Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. These are nothing but certain rules/ protocols used to connect to Web servers on the Internet or on a local network (intranet). The primary function of HTTP is to establish a connection with the server and send HTML pages back to the user's browser.
